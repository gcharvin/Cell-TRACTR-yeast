# XXX
This repository provides the implementation of [XXX](link to paper) paper by Owen O'Connor and Mary Dunlop. The codebase builds upon [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [Deformable DETR](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR) and [Trackformer](https://github.com/timmeinhardt/trackformer)

## Abstract


## Installation

We refer to our docs/INSTALL.md for detailed installation instructions

## Train XXX

XXX/src/train.py

You need to update 2 variables

    dataset: str - name of the dataset
    respath: Pathlib path - path of the results directory

## Visual

A time-lapse microscopy video of bacteria growing in the mother machine analyzed by XXX. The raw images used to generate this movie was taken from the test set within the [mother machine dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/11237127)
